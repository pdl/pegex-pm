Pegex::Input
============

Pegex Parser Input Abstraction

= Synopsis

  use Pegex;
  use Pegex::Input;
  my $ast = pegex($foo_grammar)->parse(Pegex::Input->new(string => $foo_input));

= Description

Pegex::Parser parses input. The input can be a string, a string reference, a
file path, or an open file handle. Pegex::Input is an abstraction over any
type of input. It provides a uniform inteface to the parser.

= Usage

You call new() with two arguments, where the first argument is the input type:

  Pegex::Input->new(file => 'file.txt')

The following input types are available:

- string

  Input is a string.

- stringref

  Input is a string reference. This may be desirable for really long strings.

- file

  Input is a file path name to be opened and read.

- handle

  Input is from a opened file handle, to be read.
